Olivia Todo: make face. face sits on edge and can spin

ToDo: Behaviours and Core Gameplay Loop, Databasing.

24 days of sustainable coding for core code.
+ Databasing and sciencing
+ aesthetic decisions and design.

Core Gameplay + Corresponding Drive:

explore... would needs something to... you know, actually explore.... so would need locations in the world to find, and explore for this one... otherwise, it's kinda just... not even worth having in the game
fame- within the context of the bots, i'm not sure how this one would even work, as you'd need a society for it to work... and these bots aren't exactly society makers right now...
fun- i mean it's subjective at the best of times...? the source describes it as doing something other than what you're supposed to, but if you're a bot and the only thing you're supposed to do is survive... makes it difficult...
guess could use it to do something that isn't ticking current social levers?
fury-  this one... is over reacting... so you'd need to measure if something would be an overreaction...
so you get a means to measure proportional reactions, you get a means of measuring fury
jealousy... this one's again, subjective... probably requires a rival, and gets ticked if they surpass you in some measure...
justice- proportional reaction to hostilities. see fury for that...
love- could probably be self sacrifice type things for someone with an appropiate lever...
lust- MEKKE DE BEBBE
malice- actually simple... unprovoked hostilities. boom. sorted
plunder- in the context of the game... could probably aggressively stealing another entity's bots
pride- falls under the same boat as fame...
respect- if... you could form a way of making agreements with other bots, respect could come from upholding that
revenge- nice and easy. attacking an entity a while after being attacked or having an ally attacked
solution- this'd... require puzzles...
status- ... fame, pride problem...
victory- winning! easy!
wealth... that'd mean needing a resource to accumilate...
these drives basically... make for something that's a mix between puzzle-rpg, and the sims, if i'm honestly thinking about it... so...

Design decisions: 
Explore is triggerable when the entity does not have any other entities around it.
Fun is viewed as a way of transferring trading based surplus to entity satisfaction -- obligations style though.
